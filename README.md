# Consumer Driven Contract Tests example project

This project is implemented with Java, Wiremock embeded, RestAssured, Junit 5 and Gradle

It aims to demonstrate how to create [consumer driven contract tests](https://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html).

The API used as example is the Cats Api which you can find [documentation here](https://docs.thecatapi.com/).

You can use this project to study, learn and also as a boilerplate for your own projects. 


## How to run the tests
You can run the tests by doing the following commands on your terminal:

    Linux/Mac

        ./gradlew clean test  
    
    Windows
    
        gradlew clean test 

You can also clone it via Intellij and run the tests from it.
